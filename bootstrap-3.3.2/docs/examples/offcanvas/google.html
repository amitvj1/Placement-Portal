<p>My <strong>Google Interview</strong> Experience for <strong>Software Developer Position</strong> [Android Core Team], London, United Kingdom</p>
<p>Like many other enthusiastic engineers, I too applied for a job at Google. I know that its very difficult that a resume gets noticed by google.<br />
Suddenly, one fine day I received a Mail( &#8220;Hello from Google !&#8221;) from Google&#8217;s HR saying that they are interested in my profile and asked me if I was ready to go ahead with the interview process[Come on! you cant say no to Google].</p>

<p><strong>General :</strong></p>
<p>Then came the exciting part when he asked me to choose location b/w <strong>Google Paris</strong>(Text-Speech Team) or <strong>Google London</strong>(Android Core Team).</p>
<p>He explained how Google work&#8217;s on their projects !</p>
<p>About Google interview process ( 2-3 phone interview + 4-5 onsite interview in London ).</p>

<p><strong>Some additional hints for the interview:</strong></p>
<p>Clarify the question &#8211; make sure you understand everything.</p>
<p>Try to find the most efficient solution.</p>
<p>Come up with solutions quickly: even if its a brute force solution. Always iterate away from the original solution.</p>
<p>Before you start coding explain why you&#8217;re approaching it that way ,its ok to start off with a naive solution and try to make it more efficient.</p>
<p>Explain the rationale behind the steps you are doing.</p>
<p>Think out loud, keep things technical. The engineers will give you hints: take a hint! They are there to help you!</p>
<p>Always write &#8220;compilable&#8221; code.</p>
<p>Mind edge cases. Find bugs in your code.</p>
